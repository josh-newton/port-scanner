Python Port Scanner
===================
Taken and adapted from the book [Violent Python](http://store.elsevier.com/product.jsp?isbn=9781597499576&pagename=search).

### Usage
```bash
python scanner.py -H <target host> -p <target ports>
```
Ports need to be separated by a comma. If no ports are provided it will auto scan a list of common ports.
